## Here are a couple of CSS changes to make

- add the header 'Stutern Feedback Form' at the top of the form
- change the background color of the input fields
- make the labels bolder
- change the color of the text of the input fields
- style the 'Submit feedback' button. It should have same width as the input fields. It should have a background color and a border of 2px
- the checkboxes and radio buttons are too closely packed. Add some space between them. (Tip: padding or margin can be your friend here )
- the container of the form should have a box shadow effect (I am looking forward to seeing this ðŸ˜Š)
- give the body of the page a background image

Voila!!! You are now a CSS Champion!!! ðŸ¥‡ðŸŽ‰

Of course, you have to keep learning as "Learning is a continuous process..."
